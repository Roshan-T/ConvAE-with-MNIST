# ConvAE-with-MNIST
A convolutional autoencoder implemented in Python using PyTorch. This repository demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional autoencoder model for image reconstruction and feature extraction tasks. It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and visualization of the results.
